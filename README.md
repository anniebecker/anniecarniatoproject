# anniecarniatoproject

I made this project using mostly bootstrap; a huge reason why I took this course, as I'm already a working FED. I had never used bootstrap or LESS and made sure to use it as much as I could on this project. It is NOT perfect yet, I still have a few flaws in my responsive design and other cosmetic issues to fix (add the actual pictures for portfolio, fix some spacing and copy). 

I feel I have accomplished what I wanted: get more fluent with bootstrap and less, as well as work with some simple JS animations.

Annie. :)
